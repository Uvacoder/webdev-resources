*This document gives an overview of how this website is set up.*

DevSites is a list of noteworthy resources for Website Development. It is compiled by [ [@originalzedders](https://twitter.com/originalzedders) / [Zachary](https://zacharyparsons.co.uk) ]. It is not an exhaustive list, and it can (and hopefully will be) added to continuously (aiming for once a week or more).

Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to make a contribution / help in some way.

## Requirements / Project Notes

DevSites uses [11ty](https://11ty.dev) as a Static Site Generator and is built upon the [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) starter. The project is hosted with [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and is served from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zgparsons/usefulwebdev).

Other requirements / things the project uses are listed on the site itself under [the tag 'DevSites'](https://devsites.netlify.app/tags/devsites/).


## Design Notes

DevSites uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as a CSS library / framework. This was originally done to get the project moving. The benefits of not using a framework probably outweigh the benefits of Bulma (for this small project) - the plan is to replace Bulma with project specific Sass/CSS at some point.

Originally each post included a screenshot of the site's homepage. This might be an option to return to at some point.

Accessibility has been considered while designing this project. This has been done via the 'axe' Chrome extension. Please do contact me if you are aware of any issues though.

## Dev Notes

I am a self-taught developer and am always eager to learn. If you want to know anything about how the site works or if you have suggestions for how we can improve the site please do contact me.
